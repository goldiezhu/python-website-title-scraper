# python-website-title-scraper
Uses beautiful soup to scrape website titles from a list of websites in a csv.

The original dataset was the UCI News Popularity Dataset. It contains links of news articles, for which I scraped the titles.
lists.csv is a UTF-8 CSV, which does not work for the code. You will receive the error "No connection adapters were found for '%s'" % url."
links_2.csv is a normal csv with all the website links.
links_3.csv is the csv where all the scraped titles will be added to.
